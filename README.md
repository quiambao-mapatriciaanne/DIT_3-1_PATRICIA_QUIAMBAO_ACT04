# Reflection:
1. How did you implement event handling for user actions?  
- I used `setOnClickListener` on the Submit button to capture user input and display it in the TextView.
2.What techniques ensured smooth and stable interaction? 
- I used input validation and Toast messages to handle empty fields and invalid data, ensuring no crashes.
3.What improvements would you add in future versions?
- Add input formatting, real-time validation, and UI enhancements like Snackbar feedback or dark mode.
